Marpa parser for parsing Marpa
==============================

What is this?
-------------

This is a program that generates a Marpa::XS::Grammar and lexer from a textual
specification.

Marpa doesn't itself contain a program that creates new parsers from textfiles.
This program first creates a new Marpa parser generator from a textfile
containing a description of a Marpa parser.

Is this related to Marpa?
-------------------------

Well, not really, only in that it uses this library. It's not an official Marpa
module in any way.
